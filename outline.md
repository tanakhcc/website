# How to Help
## Pray
```
אִם־יְהוָ֤ה׀ לֹא־יִבְנֶ֬ה בַ֗יִת שָׁ֤וְא׀ עָמְל֣וּ בֹונָ֣יו בֹּ֑ו

When the LORD does not build the house, its builders strive in vain.
```
While TanakhCC deliberately has no specific theological commitment, I firmly believe that this project can only function through Gods great love for his people.
Please pray for the success of TanakhCC, and that all dedication poured into it by volunteers bring good fruit for Gods great kingdom.

## Spread the Word
TanakhCC depends on volunteers to function and produce results in a forseeable timespan.
It also depends on many simply using it - our work is not meant to tick checkboxes but to help people.
If you know anyone who may be excited about TanakhCC or who may benefit from its data, feel free to share this resource.

## Transcribe
You know classical(biblical) hebrew and can help transcribe manuscripts?
Try it out, every hour of work helps!
Transcribing manuscripts does not require specific training and can be picked up quickly by anyone familiar with classical hebrew.
Your work will always be compared with the transcriptions of others before being published, so you do not need to worry about making some mistakes!
Go ahead and check out [the guide to tanakhcc](https://tanakhcc.org/guide), where you will get all the information you need to get started.

## Translate
If you are able to translate this website, or [critic, our transcription tool](https://critic.tanakhcc.org) into a new language, please reach out to mailto:info@tanakhcc.org .
Making TanakhCC available to non-english speakers is a great opportunity to bless even more people with it.
